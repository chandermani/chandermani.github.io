*Good vs Bad Software Engineer*, while a cliche topic, was something that I wanted to write about. Thankfully I realized very early, there are no good or bad engineers, instead, there are engineers that improve over time and the ones that don't. Everyone starts the journey at various points in the badness meter and with persistent effort become better at their work. 

> A bad engineer is one who does not improve with time.

So I am not going to focus my energy, writing about a topic with a negative connotation. Instead what I am going to do is to put my perspective on how to improve at your craft and becoming a better software engineer. Something that I really care about.

### Know your tools

One of the metric to measure skills of a engineer is productivity. Productivity is the ability to generate high-quality results with least amount of effort and time.

Tools play a big part in ensuring engineer productivity. A feature rich IDE, a capable debugger, a great unit testing tool/framework make our life simple. The onus is then on us to make the best use of these tools.

Take the IDE, it's is a cardinal sin if you don't know the keyboard shortcuts for all the common task you perform every day inside the IDE.

Using a debugger (maybe part of IDE or not), learn about its capabilities and how to debug effectively. Example, do you know the difference between *Step Into*, *Step Over*, and *Step Out*.

You can go a step further and extend your IDE with numerous useful extension/add-on. Most popular IDE's extensions/add-ons that can make your life easier. Extensions/add-ons such as ReSharper (for Visual Studio), TSLint (for Visual Studio Code) are some good examples in this category.

The bottom line, learn to use your tools effectively and constantly look to new tools/extension that can further reduce manual effort.

### Handling Information Explosion

Even with a decade of experience under my belt, I still at times am totally overwhelmed with the pace at which the technology is evolving. Keeping abreast with what's happening around can be very daunting. How do we manage this information explosion? There are few things that have to help me keep ahead of the learning curve. These include

#### Healthy mix of new technology and fundamentals

While technology evolves everyday, fundamentals remain the same (or do not evolve that rapidly). Still I see a mad rush to learn new technologies and a disregard for fundamentals understanding of underlying principals. The fundamentals may vary based on domain, but these are the building block for any technical expertise. Be it programming fundamentals, networking fundamentals, Operating System (OS) fundamentals, web platform fundamentals we ought to have our fundamentals in place.

If you are a web engineer, while learning the new uber cool JS framework out there help, you cannot ignore the building blocks of web which are, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Have you spend time understand how CSS works? Do you understand the nuances of *this*, what is a *closure*, what is *prototypal inheritance* in JavaScript?

There are some classics (books) out there for every engineer to read and are almost technology agnostic. Read them! There is a small list that i want to share (in no particular order):
[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/)
[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
[Code Complete](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670)
[Release it](https://www.amazon.com/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213)
[Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)
[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672)

The good thing about these books is that the concepts have application across the technologies you explore, languages you learn.

#### Follow the thought leaders

Every professional field has some thought leaders who are best at their trade. Identify thought leaders in your area and follow them, read what they write, explore what they endorse. Remember they have walked the path you are on now. Learn from them.

#### Follow high quality content aggregators

There are some excellent content aggregators out there. Sites like 
[InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/) - A great resource for software engineers with focus on software development. A site that I personally use and recommend.
[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
[TechCrunch] (https://techcrunch.com/) - for business and tech new
[ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com) - From the site *"Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations."*

Such sites do a great job of aggregating high quality content, helping us keep ahead of the tech curve.

### Don't give up when the going gets tough

I have worked with engineers who yearn for challenges and the ones that are content with just copy/paste. The tendency of copy/paste engineers is to learn the easy parts of a new technology and/or project and ignore/delay the not so easy stuff. They always looking for shortcuts/hacks when working on any non trivial assignment. Such people focus mainly on getting things done, instead of getting things done the right way.

An example of this that is fresh in my mind is around AngularJS. We adopted Angular 3 years back and everyone in our team was new on the platform. Overtime the engineers that excelled at AngularJS were the one who looked beyond the standard usage of AngularJS. They understood what prototypal inheritance was, how did AngularJS data-binding worked, how/when to create directives (html extensions).

To become a better engineer you cannot be one who learning everything at a superficial level. I expect you to at least develop expertise in product/technology areas that you work day in and day out. Something that I touch again later in this post.

### Understand the big picture

*Understand the big picture*. If this has not been told to you in one form or another then you have not builds anything substantial! At times when working on a problem our focus is too narrow. At times we do not understand how the components we are building fits into the complete solution context. Neither are we aware of  of the business value of our deliverables. This leads to sub-optimal solutions and/or missed requirements. Avoid this, and always, always look at the big picture! This part of you growing up in your role and skills.

Besides the solution delivered and business value context described above, there is one more vector that I would want to add. Understand the big picture in term of the *software development life cycle* (SDLC).

I remember my early days, fresh out of college I had a preconception that software development is all about writing code and everything else is optional. Boy, was I wrong!

Writing code while important is just on facet of software development. There is more to it, and you need to understand the big picture here too!

To become a better engineer, learn about all aspect of building software and if possible get involved. Learn about requirement gathering, prioritization/triaging, project/sprint planning, deployment (CI/CD), testing (automated, smoke, regression, UAT) release management, operations, support. The earlier you learn about them the better you understand the big picture. Don't restrict yourself to to taking requirement, building the software and throwing the code to the other side of the wall for someone to test. You will never grow!

### Learn about operations

Thanks to the *devops* culture, engineers are getting involved in areas which they had limited exposure earlier. This is definitely helping everyone understand the big picture and write better software.

If your have not adopted devops, then I highly encourage you to learn about the deployment and operational aspect of your software. You need to get better at what you are developing, you need to understand where it gets deployed and how is it consumed/used by end customer. Learn about your solutions deployment topology, how deployments/releases are made, what operations team is doing. How are they monitoring the health of the deployment.

### Learn from mistakes

Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes. - Oscar Wilde
You will make mistakes! Learn from your mistake and from mistake that you observe others making. Mistakes are part our learning process, and as long as we learn from them and take corrective measures these mistakes gives us great insights into what works, what does not and why it does not. It is difficult to appreciate the right way of doing things unless you have made a few mistakes and suffered the consequences. But remember:
Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all yourself - Eleanor Roosevelt
A great engineers makes fewer mistakes, learns from others and makes sure he does not repeat them again.

### Become expert on things you are actively involved

Pick any technology domain and I bet you can spend copious amount of time mastering it. There is so much to learn that when it comes to actually deciding what's worth our time we become indecisive. The easiest choice here is to gain an in-depth expertise on areas that you are actively involved in, the technologies that your project uses, the technology stack your Org endorses. This is also a great way to standout among your peers and align with the business needs.

### Challenge status quo

One of the hallmark a skilled professional/master is that they do not accept status quo. They are constantly striving for improvements in all aspects of their domain of influence. Part of this is not accepting the cliché "But we have always done it this way". This also means having an opinion and strong foundation to support your opinion. To challenge status quo requires us to be expert in our domain and look at everyday work challenges with fresh perspective.

### Learn for your peers

I have saved best for the last. Pairing with a smart coworkers is accelerated learning! Working with a master, teaches you more than what is possible through any book/video/tutorial. Working with a expert gives you deep insight into how an expert approaches a problem, deconstructs it, structures and verifies his solution. If your organization is a proponent of of practices such as Pair Programming great benefits can be derived by working with masters of their trade.
While this is the best form of learning it is not always possible to pair with someone and work. The next best option is to look at their work/code/solution and learn from it. The web has made this a level playing field, if there is no one around you, look at GitHub repos of smart engineers and great project.
