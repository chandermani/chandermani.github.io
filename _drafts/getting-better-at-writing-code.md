*Good vs Bad Developer*, while a cliche topic, was something that I wanted to write about. Thankfully i realized very early, there are no good or bad developer, instead there are developers that improve over time and the ones that don't. Everyone starts journey at various points in the badness meter and with persistent effort become better at writing code. 

> A bad developer is one who does not improve with time. 

So I am not going to focus my energy, writing about a topic with negative connotation. Instead what I am going to do is to put my perspective on how to improve at your craft and becoming a better software developer. Something that I really care about.

### Know your tools
One of the metric to measure skills of a developer is, productivity. Productivity is the ability to generate high quality results with least amount of effort and time. 

Tools play a big part in ensuring developer productivity. A feature rich IDE, a capable debugger, a great unit testing tool/framework make our life simple. The onus is then on us to make best use of these tools. 

Take the IDE, it's is cardinal sin if you don't know the keyboard shortcuts for all the common task you perform everyday inside the IDE. 

Using a debugger (maybe part of IDE or not), learn about it capabilities and how to debug effectively. Example, do you know the difference between *Step Into*, *Step Over*, and *Step Out*.

You can go a step further and extend your IDE with numerous useful extension/addin. Most popular IDE's extensions/addins that can make your life easier. Extensions/addins such as ReSharper (for Visual Studio), TSLint (for Visual Studio Code) are some good example in this category.

The bottom line, learn to use your tools effectively and constantly look to new tools or extension that can further reduce manual effort.

### Handling Information Explosion
Even with decade of experience under my belt, I still at times am totally overwhelmed with pace at which the technology is evolving. Keeping oneself abreast with what's happening around can be very daunting. How do we manage this information explosion. There are few things that have help me be ahead of the learning curve. These include
