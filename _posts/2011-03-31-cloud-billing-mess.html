"with great power comes great responsibility" - Spiderman Movie<div>Nothing can be more true than this statement when it comes to Cloud. Spinning up a new server is effortless, scaling up and down even easier. While building a cloud based solution for our client we too have made same mistakes. Since the impact of such mistakes are not immediate these thing many a times go unnoticed. It is not until we receive inflated bills that we start looking into such matters and realize our mistakes.</div><div><br /></div><div>Cloud infrastructure should not cause an organization to abandon all server provisioning workflows but tweak them to take Cloud components into consideration.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>Chandermani</div>
