I justed moved from a 32 bit laptop to a 64 bit laptop. The project we are working on uses Acrobat Reader activex control to show PDF documents. When I ran the project on my system from VS 2008 the application threw exception while trying to load the PDF viewer control. The error returned was<br /><strong><em>"Class not registered HRESULT 0x80040154..."</em></strong><br />The issue turned out to be that the solution was compiled for "Any CPU"\x64 bit architecture. Once i changed the build configuration to x86 and recompiled the error was resolved. It intially seemed like the component was not installed correctly and i tried to reinstall Acrobat Reader multiple times before hitting the correct solution.<br /><br /><br />Happy Coding<br />Chandermani
